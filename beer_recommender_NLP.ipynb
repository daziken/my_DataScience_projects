beżowa szybciutko redukowała się niewielkiego krążka po zakręceniu kielichem pozostawały tylko nieliczne kropeczki na ściankach zapach po zrzuceniu magicznego firmowego kapselka poczułem najpiękniejszy najbardziej wyraźny aromat bourbonu jaki kiedykolwiek czułem w piwie zapach mocnej dębowej beczki mokrego drewna destylatu tego szlachetnego alkoholu aromat był tak głęboki piękny że bałem się nawet zakręcić butelką aby wydobyć kolejne składowe po kilku chwilach poruszyłem lekko butelką zaczęła się kolejna euforia zapachowa czego tutaj nie było potężna waniliowa petarda lody

samego początku czuć także wpływy beczki jej przemoczone drewno dąb amerykański oraz niekończący się posmak waniliny na dalszym planie pojawiają się akcenty czekolady nadziewanej mlecznych pralinek truflii czekoladowych karmelu wiśni śliwek w czekoladzie tudzież baryłek z alkoholem w środku z daleka wyczuwalne są także na języku wiśnie odrobina lukrecji zdumiewający jak dla mnie jest fakt że jest tutaj minimum posmaków kawowych tak bardzo charakterystycznych dla 90% ris_ów smak jest niesamowicie kompleksowy wielowymiarowy goryczka jest średnia z długim czekoladowym likierowym posmakiem w ustach alkohol jest delikatnie wyczuwalny ale nie wymagam od tego piwa cudów w końcu 14 3% obj alk w niektórych 9% wych imperialnych stoutach był bardziej wyczuwalny jest rozgrzewający ale nie gryzący
